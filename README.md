# Lentivirus Genome Visualization
A JBrowse2-powered database for exploring the genomes and proteomic features of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV.
To access the database, open the Github pages link, https://typicaldegree.github.io/lentivirus-jbrowse2-package (old xbox 360 username don't judge)
To access the genomes/annotations, click on Linear Genome View, and you will be able to toggle between the HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV genomes.
To access the 3-D protein structures, click new session, then from the dropdown select Protein View. Click the toggle controls panel on the right (icon is a wrench) and under remote states, you will be able to see the protein structures relevant to HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV.
